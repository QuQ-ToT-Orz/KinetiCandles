integrates multi-device temporal data streams with different sampling rates and timestamps into a unified timeline, resolving synchronization issues that commonly plague multi-sensor movement behavior studies.

reveals recurrent temporal patterns and cyclical behaviors in longitudinal movement data through visual analytics and machine learning techniques, allowing researchers to discover hidden rhythms and behavioral signatures within seemingly complex data.

Refinement of a user-friendly interface for visualizing
